learning model to go from one sequence to another, using PyTorch. This will be done on German to English translations, but the models can be applied to any problem that involves going from one sequence to another, such as summarization, i.e. going from a sequence to a shorter sequence in the same language.\n\nIn this first notebook, we'll start simple to understand the general concepts by implementing the model from the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) paper.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are _encoder-decoder_ models, which commonly use a _recurrent neural network_ (RNN) to _encode_ the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a _context vector_. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then _decoded_ by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/main/assets/seq2seq1.png?raw=1)\n\nThe above image shows an example translation. The input/source sentence, \"guten morgen\", is passed through the embedding layer (yellow) and then input into the encoder (green). We also append a _start of sequence_ (`<sos>`) and _end of sequence_ (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the embedding, $e$, of the current word, $e(x_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. We can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $e(x_t)$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n\n$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(e(x_t), h_{t-1})$$\n\nWe're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an _LSTM_ (Long Short-Term Memory) or a _GRU_ (Gated Recurrent Unit).\n\nHere, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n\nOnce the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN via the embedding layer, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n\nNow we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the output/target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the embedding, $d$, of current word, $d(y_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n\n$$s_t = \\text{DecoderRNN}(d(y_t), s_{t-1})$$\n\nAlthough the input/source embedding layer, $e$, and the output/target embedding layer, $d$, are both shown in yellow in the diagram they are two different embedding layers with their own parameters.\n\nIn the decoder, we need to go from the hidden state to an actual word, therefore at each time-step we use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$.\n\n$$\\hat{y}_t = f(s_t)$$\n\nThe words in the decoder are always generated one after another, with one per time-step. We always use `<sos>` for the first input to the decoder, $y_1$, but for subsequent inputs, $y_{t>1}$, we will sometimes use the actual, ground truth next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the word predicted by our decoder, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called _teacher forcing_, see a bit more info about it [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/).\n\nWhen training/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n\nOnce we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n","metadata":{"id":"nyumTO8pq9mZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# # NOTE: If you are running this notebook on Google Colab,\n# #       then uncomment the two lines below and then run this cell!\n\n# !pip install datasets evaluate --upgrade\n# !python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm","metadata":{"id":"-aL3Oe4zdIIV","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-16T15:15:19.822107Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-16T15:15:19.822422Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-16T15:15:19.827901Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-16T15:15:19.822395Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-16T15:15:19.827122Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparing Data\n\nFirst up, importing all the necessary libraries.

The vocabulary is used to associate each unique token in our dataset with an index (an integer), e.g. \"hello\" = 1, \"world\" = 2, \"bye\" = 3, \"hates\" = 4, etc. When feeding text data to our model, we convert the string into tokens and then the tokens into numbers using the vocabulary as a look up table, e.g. \"hello world\" becomes `[\"hello\", \"world\"]` which becomes `[1, 2]` using the example indices given. We do this as neural networks cannot operate on strings, only numerical values.\n\nWe create the vocabulary (one for each language) from our datasets using the `build_vocab_from_iterator` function, provided by `torchtext`, which accepts an iterator where each item is a list of tokens. It then counts up the number of unique tokens and assigns each a numerical value.\n\nIn theory, our vocabulary can be large enough to have an index for every unique token in our dataset. However, what happens if a token exists in our validation and test set, but not in our training set? In that case, we replace the token with an \"unknown token\", denoted by `<unk>`, which is given its own index (usually index zero). All unknown tokens are replaced by `<unk>`, even if the tokens are different, i.e. if the tokens \"gilgamesh\" and \"enkidu\" were both not within our vocabulary, then the string \"gilgamesh hates enkidu\" gets tokenized to `[\"gilgamesh\", \"hates\", \"enkidu\"]` and then becomes `[0, 24, 0]` (where \"hates\" has the index 24).\n\nIdeally, we want our model to be able to handle unknown tokens by learning to use the context around them to make translations. The only way it can learn that is if we also have unknown tokens in the training set. Hence, when creating our vocabularies with `build_vocab_from_iterator`, we use the `min_freq` argument to not create an index for tokens which appear less than `min_freq` times in our training set. In other words, when using the vocabulary, any token which does not appear at least twice in our training set will get replaced by the unknown token index when converting tokens to indices.\n\nIt is important to note that a vocabulary should only be built from the training set and never the validation or test set. This prevents \"information leakage\" into our model, giving us artifically inflated validation/test scores.\n\nWe also use the `specials` argument of `build_vocab_from_iterator` to pass _special tokens_. These are tokens which we want to add to the vocabulary but do not necessarily appear in our tokenized examples. These special tokens will appear first in the vocabulary. We've already discussed the `unk_token`, `sos_token`, and `eos_token`. The final special token is the `pad_token`, denoted by `<pad>`.\n\nWhen inputting sentences into our model, it is more efficient to pass multiple sentences at once (known as a batch), instead of one at a time. The requirement for sentences to be batched together is that they all have to be the same length (in terms of the number of tokens). The majority of our sentences are not the same length, but we can solve this by \"padding\" (adding `<pad>` tokens) the tokenized version of each sentence in a batch until they all have equal tokens to the longest sentence in the batch. For example, if we had two sentences: \"I love pizza\" and \"I hate music videos\". They would be tokenized to something like: `[\"i\", \"love\", \"pizza\"]` and `[\"i\", \"hate\", \"music\", \"videos\"]`. The first sequence of tokens would then be padded to `[\"i\", \"love\", \"pizza\", \"<pad>\"]`. Both sequences could then be converted to indexes using the vocabulary.\n\nThat was a lot of information, but luckily `torchtext` handles all the fuss of building the vocabulary. We'll handle the padding and batching later.\n","metadata":{"id":"NBLxI46dq9md"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"min_freq = 2\nunk_token = \"<unk>\"\npad_token = \"<pad>\"\n\nspecial_tokens = [\n    unk_token,\n    pad_token,\n    sos_token,\n    eos_token,\n]\n\nen_vocab = torchtext.vocab.build_vocab_from_iterator(\n    train_data[\"en_tokens\"],\n    min_freq=min_freq,\n    specials=special_tokens,\n)\n\nde_vocab = torchtext.vocab.build_vocab_from_iterator(\n    train_data[\"de_tokens\"],\n    min_freq=min_freq,\n    specials=special_tokens,\n)","metadata":{"id":"fjPGOPTWq9md","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-16T15:15:56.406544Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-16T15:15:56.406902Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.312143Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-16T15:15:56.406872Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.311134Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we have our vocabularies, we can check what's actually in them.\n\nWe can get the first ten tokens in our vocabulary (indices 0 to 9) using the `get_itos` method, where itos = \"**i**nt **to** **s**tring\", which returns a list of tokens.\n","metadata":{"id":"xNOKQSwpq9md"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"en_vocab.get_itos()[:10]","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hq2FF4Fhq9md","outputId":"ae3d4a90-e3a4-4a0e-939e-c302d4604fff","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.313463Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.314289Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.322168Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.314251Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.321221Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['<unk>', '<pad>', '<sos>', '<eos>', 'a', '.', 'in', 'the', 'on', 'man']"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"en_vocab.get_itos()[9]","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"LtO7MeLwq9md","outputId":"34ab6a7d-8a12-4478-e5a8-5758b8a8da02","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.323379Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.323740Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.333033Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.323709Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-16T15:15:58.332242Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'man'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can do the same for the German vocabulary.

The encoder, the decoder and a seq2seq model that encapsulates the encoder and decoder and will provide a way to interface with each.\n\n### Encoder\n\nFirst, the encoder, a 2 layer LSTM. The paper we are implementing uses a 4-layer LSTM, but in the interest of training time we cut this down to 2-layers. The concept of multi-layer RNNs is easy to expand from 2 to 4 layers.\n\nFor a multi-layer RNN, the input sentence, $X$, after being embedded goes into the first (bottom) layer of the RNN and hidden states, $H=\\{h_1, h_2, ..., h_T\\}$, output by this layer are used as inputs to the RNN in the layer above. Thus, representing each layer with a superscript, the hidden states in the first layer are given by:\n\n$$h_t^1 = \\text{EncoderRNN}^1(e(x_t), h_{t-1}^1)$$\n\nThe hidden states in the second layer are given by:\n\n$$h_t^2 = \\text{EncoderRNN}^2(h_t^1, h_{t-1}^2)$$\n\nUsing a multi-layer RNN also means we'll also need an initial hidden state as input per layer, $h_0^l$, and we will also output a context vector per layer, $z^l$.\n\nWithout going into too much detail about LSTMs (see [this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) blog post to learn more about them), all we need to know is that they're a type of RNN which instead of just taking in a hidden state and returning a new hidden state per time-step, also take in and return a _cell state_, $c_t$, per time-step.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nh_t &= \\text{RNN}(e(x_t), h_{t-1})\\\\\n(h_t, c_t) &= \\text{LSTM}(e(x_t), h_{t-1}, c_{t-1})\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe can just think of $c_t$ as another type of hidden state. Similar to $h_0^l$, $c_0^l$ will be initialized to a tensor of all zeros. Also, our context vector will now be both the final hidden state and the final cell state, i.e. $z^l = (h_T^l, c_T^l)$.\n\nExtending our multi-layer equations to LSTMs, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(h_t^1, c_t^1) &= \\text{EncoderLSTM}^1(e(x_t), (h_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1))\\\\\n(h_t^2, c_t^2) &= \\text{EncoderLSTM}^2(h_t^1, (h_{t-1}^2, c_{t-1}^2))\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote how only our hidden state from the first layer is passed as input to the second layer, and not the cell state.\n\nSo our encoder looks something like this:\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/main/assets/seq2seq2.png?raw=1)\n\nWe create this in code by making an `Encoder` module, which requires we inherit from `torch.nn.Module` and use the `super().__init__()` as some boilerplate code. The encoder takes the following arguments:\n\n-   `input_dim` is the size/dimensionality of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the encoder. This is equal to the input (source) vocabulary size.\n-   `embedding_dim` is the dimensionality of the embedding layer. This layer converts the one-hot vectors into dense vectors with `embedding_dim` dimensions.\n-   `hidden_dim` is the dimensionality of the hidden and cell states.\n-   `n_layers` is the number of layers in the RNN.\n-   `dropout` is the amount of dropout to use. This is a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting. Check out [this](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/understanding-dropout-YaGbR) for more details about dropout.\n\nWe aren't going to discuss the embedding layer in detail during these tutorials. All we need to know is that there is a step before the words - technically, the indexes of the words - are passed into the RNN, where the words are transformed into vectors. To read more about word embeddings, check these articles: [1](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/), [2](http://p.migdal.pl/2017/01/06/king-man-woman-queen-why.html), [3](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/), [4](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/).\n\nThe embedding layer is created using `nn.Embedding`, the LSTM with `nn.LSTM` and a dropout layer with `nn.Dropout`. Check the PyTorch [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) for more about these.\n\nOne thing to note is that the `dropout` argument to the LSTM is how much dropout to apply between the layers of a multi-layer RNN, i.e. between the hidden states output from layer $l$ and those same hidden states being used for the input of layer $l+1$.\n\nIn the `forward` method, we pass in the source sentence, $X$, which is converted into dense vectors using the `embedding` layer, and then dropout is applied. These embeddings are then passed into the RNN. As we pass a whole sequence to the RNN, it will automatically do the recurrent calculation of the hidden states over the whole sequence for us! Notice that we do not pass an initial hidden or cell state to the RNN. This is because, as noted in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM), that if no hidden/cell state is passed to the RNN, it will automatically create an initial hidden/cell state as a tensor of all zeros.\n\nThe RNN returns: `outputs` (the top-layer hidden state for each time-step), `hidden` (the final hidden state for each layer, $h_T$, stacked on top of each other) and `cell` (the final cell state for each layer, $c_T$, stacked on top of each other).\n\nAs we only need the final hidden and cell states (to make our context vector), `forward` only returns `hidden` and `cell`.\n\nThe sizes of each of the tensors is left as comments in the code. In this implementation `n_directions` will always be 1, however note that bidirectional RNNs (covered in tutorial 3) will have `n_directions` as 2.\n","metadata":{"id":"JZlH3UOUq9mj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Encoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim\n        self.n_layers = n_layers\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, embedding_dim)\n        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout=dropout)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n\n    def forward(self, src):\n        #

The first layer will receive a hidden and cell state from the previous time-step, $(s_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1)$, and feeds it through the LSTM with the current embedded token, $y_t$, to produce a new hidden and cell state, $(s_t^1, c_t^1)$. The subsequent layers will use the hidden state from the layer below, $s_t^{l-1}$, and the previous hidden and cell states from their layer, $(s_{t-1}^l, c_{t-1}^l)$. This provides equations very similar to those in the encoder.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(s_t^1, c_t^1) = \\text{DecoderLSTM}^1(d(y_t), (s_{t-1}^1, c_{t-1}^1))\\\\\n(s_t^2, c_t^2) = \\text{DecoderLSTM}^2(s_t^1, (s_{t-1}^2, c_{t-1}^2))\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nRemember that the initial hidden and cell states to our decoder are our context vectors, which are the final hidden and cell states of our encoder from the same layer, i.e. $(s_0^l,c_0^l)=z^l=(h_T^l,c_T^l)$.\n\nWe then pass the hidden state from the top layer of the RNN, $s_t^L$, through a linear layer, $f$, to make a prediction of what the next token in the target (output) sequence should be, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$.\n\n$$\\hat{y}_{t+1} = f(s_t^L)$$\n\nThe arguments and initialization are similar to the `Encoder` class, except we now have an `output_dim` which is the size of the vocabulary for the output/target language. There is also the addition of the `Linear` layer, used to make the predictions from the top layer hidden state.\n\nWithin the `forward` method, we accept a batch of input tokens, previous hidden states and previous cell states. As we are only decoding one token at a time, the input tokens will always have a sequence length of 1. We `unsqueeze` the input tokens to add a sentence length dimension of 1. Then, similar to the encoder, we pass through an embedding layer and apply dropout. This batch of embedded tokens is then passed into the RNN with the previous hidden and cell states. This produces an `output` (hidden state from the top layer of the RNN), a new `hidden` state (one for each layer, stacked on top of each other) and a new `cell` state (also one per layer, stacked on top of each other). We then pass the `output` (after getting rid of the sentence length dimension) through the linear layer to receive our `prediction`. We then return the `prediction`, the new `hidden` state and the new `cell` state.\n\n**Note**: as we always have a sequence length of 1, we could use `nn.LSTMCell`, instead of `nn.LSTM`, as it is designed to handle a batch of inputs that aren't necessarily in a sequence. `nn.LSTMCell` is just a single cell and `nn.LSTM` is a wrapper around potentially multiple cells. Using the `nn.LSTMCell` in this case would mean we don't have to `unsqueeze` to add a fake sequence length dimension, but we would need one `nn.LSTMCell` per layer in the decoder and to ensure each `nn.LSTMCell` receives the correct initial hidden state from the encoder. All of this makes the code less concise -- hence the decision to stick with the regular `nn.LSTM`.\n","metadata":{"id":"LQr0RRauq9mj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Decoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, output_dim, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.output_dim = output_dim\n        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim\n        self.n_layers = n_layers\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_dim, embedding_dim)\n        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout=dropout)\n        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)\n\n    def forward(self, input, hidden, cell):\n        #

This will handle:\n\n-   receiving the input/source sentence\n-   using the encoder to produce the context vectors\n-   using the decoder to produce the predicted output/target sentence\n\nOur full model will look like this:\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/main/assets/seq2seq4.png?raw=1)\n\nThe `Seq2Seq` model takes in an `Encoder`, `Decoder`, and a `device` (used to place tensors on the GPU, if it exists).\n\nFor this implementation, we have to ensure that the number of layers and the hidden (and cell) dimensions are equal in the `Encoder` and `Decoder`. This is not always the case, we do not necessarily need the same number of layers or the same hidden dimension sizes in a sequence-to-sequence model. However, if we did something like having a different number of layers then we would need to make decisions about how this is handled. For example, if our encoder has 2 layers and our decoder only has 1, how is this handled? Do we average the two context vectors output by the decoder? Do we pass both through a linear layer? Do we only use the context vector from the highest layer? Etc.\n\nOur `forward` method takes the source sentence, target sentence and a teacher-forcing ratio. The teacher forcing ratio is used when training our model. When decoding, at each time-step we will predict what the next token in the target sequence will be from the previous tokens decoded, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}=f(s_t^L)$. With probability equal to the teaching forcing ratio (`teacher_forcing_ratio`) we will use the actual ground-truth next token in the sequence as the input to the decoder during the next time-step. However, with probability `1 - teacher_forcing_ratio`, we will use the token that the model predicted as the next input to the model, even if it doesn't match the actual next token in the sequence.\n\nThe first thing we do in the `forward` method is to create an `outputs` tensor that will store all of our predictions, $\\hat{Y}$.\n\nWe then feed the input/source sentence, `src`, into the encoder and receive out final hidden and cell states.\n\nThe first input to the decoder is the start of sequence (`<sos>`) token. As our `trg` tensor already has the `<sos>` token appended (all the way back when we tokenized our English sentences) we get our $y_1$ by slicing into it. We know how long our target sentences should be (`trg_length`), so we loop that many times. The last token input into the decoder is the one **before** the `<eos>` token -- the `<eos>` token is never input into the decoder.\n\nDuring each iteration of the loop, we:\n\n-   pass the input, previous hidden and previous cell states ($y_t, s_{t-1}, c_{t-1}$) into the decoder\n-   receive a prediction, next hidden state and next cell state ($\\hat{y}_{t+1}, s_{t}, c_{t}$) from the decoder\n-   place our prediction, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$/`output` in our tensor of predictions, $\\hat{Y}$/`outputs`\n-   decide if we are going to \"teacher force\" or not\n    -   if we do, the next `input` is the ground-truth next token in the sequence, $y_{t+1}$/`trg[t]`\n    -   if we don't, the next `input` is the predicted next token in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$/`top1`, which we get by doing an `argmax` over the output tensor\n\nOnce we've made all of our predictions, we return our tensor full of predictions, $\\hat{Y}$/`outputs`.\n\n**Note**: our decoder loop starts at 1, not 0. This means the 0th element of our `outputs` tensor remains all zeros. So our `trg` and `outputs` look something like:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [<sos>, &y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [0, &\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nLater on when we calculate the loss, we cut off the first element of each tensor to get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trg} = [&y_1, y_2, y_3, <eos>]\\\\\n\\text{outputs} = [&\\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, \\hat{y}_3, <eos>]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n","metadata":{"id":"KfHmbwMTq9mj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Seq2Seq(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, device):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.encoder = encoder\n        self.decoder = decoder\n        self.device = device\n        assert (\n            encoder.hidden_dim == decoder.hidden_dim\n        ), \"Hidden dimensions of encoder and decoder must be equal!\"\n        assert (\n            encoder.n_layers == decoder.n_layers\n        ), \"Encoder and decoder must have equal number of layers!\"\n\n    def forward(self, src, trg, teacher_forcing_ratio):\n        #

It means we aren't overfitting on the validation set.\n\nYou might think it's impossible to overfit on the validation set, but it's not. Every time you tweak your hyperparameters (e.g. optimizer, learning rate, model architecture, weight initialization, etc.) in order to get better results on the validation set, you are slowly overfitting those hyperparameters to your validation set. You can also do this on the test set too! Hence, you should evaluate your model on your test set as few times as possible.\n\nMost papers using neural networks for translation don't give their results in terms of loss and perplexity on the test set, they usually give the [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) score. Unlike loss/perplexity, BLEU is a value between zero and one, where higher is better, and [according to the original BLEU paper](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf) it has a high correlation with human judgement.\n\nTo get our model's BLEU score on the test set, we first need to use our model to translate every example from our test set, which we do with the `translate_sentence` function below. The function first converts the input `sentence` into `tokens`, optionally lowercases each `token`, and then appends the start and end of sequence tokens, `sos_token` and `eos_token`. It then uses the vocabulary to numericalize the tokens into `ids` and converts these `ids` into a `tensor`, adding a \"fake\" batch dimension, and then passes the `tensor` through the `encoder` to get the `hidden` and `cell` states. We then perform the decoding, starting with the `sos_token`, converting it into a tensor, passing it through the `decoder`, getting the `predicted_token` our model thinks is most likely to be next in the sequence, which we append to our list of `inputs` to the decoder. If the `predicted_token` is the end of sequence token then we stop decoding, if not we continue the loop, using the `predicted_token` as the next input to the decoder. We keep decoding until the decoder outputs the `eos_token` or we hit `max_output_length` (which we use to avoid the decoder just generating tokens forever). Once we've stopped decoding, we convert out inputs into `tokens` using our vocabulary and return them.\n","metadata":{"id":"7rHx8gX-q9mk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def translate_sentence(\n    sentence,\n    model,\n    en_nlp,\n    de_nlp,\n    en_vocab,\n    de_vocab,\n    lower,\n    sos_token,\n    eos_token,\n    device,\n    max_output_length=25,\n):\n    model.eval()\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        if isinstance(sentence, str):\n            tokens = [token.text for token in de_nlp.tokenizer(sentence)]\n        else:\n            tokens = [token for token in sentence]\n        if lower:\n            tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]\n        tokens = [sos_token] + tokens + [eos_token]\n        ids = de_vocab.lookup_indices(tokens)\n        tensor = torch.LongTensor(ids).unsqueeze(-1).to(device)\n        hidden, cell, e = model.encoder(tensor)\n        inputs = en_vocab.lookup_indices([sos_token])\n        for _ in range(max_output_length):\n            inputs_tensor = torch.LongTensor([inputs[-1]]).to(device)\n            output, hidden, cell, _ = model.decoder(inputs_tensor, hidden, cell, e)\n            predicted_token = output.argmax(-1).item()\n            inputs.append(predicted_token)\n            if predicted_token == en_vocab[eos_token]:\n                break\n        tokens = en_vocab.lookup_tokens(inputs)\n    return tokens","metadata":{"id":"3xSEjeCNq9mk","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll pass a test example (something the model hasn't been trained on) to use as a sentence to test our `translate_sentence` function, passing in the German sentence and expecting to get something that looks like the English sentence.\n","metadata":{"id":"PzlxVqAPq9ml"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sentence = test_data[0][\"de\"]\nexpected_translation = test_data[0][\"en\"]\n\nsentence, expected_translation","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2XzSa0lHq9ml","outputId":"6630479b-9059-42bc-d2bf-29a45050c5b6","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"translation = translate_sentence(\n    sentence,\n    model,\n    en_nlp,\n    de_nlp,\n    en_vocab,\n    de_vocab,\n    lower,\n    sos_token,\n    eos_token,\n    device,\n)","metadata":{"id":"vAqVkuVqq9ml","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our model has seemed to have figured out that the input sentence mentions a man wearing an item of clothing (though gets both the color and the item wrong), but it can't seem to figure out what the man is doing.\n\nWe shouldn't be expecting amazing results, our model is relatively small to what is used in the paper we're implementing (they use four layers with embedding and hidden dimensions of 1000) and is miniscule compared to modern translation models (which have billions of parameters).\n","metadata":{"id":"GZjr6ixBq9ml"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"translation","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JJc1eA27q9ml","outputId":"62c115ed-1c81-47dc-ad2e-269c94aab8fb","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The model doesn't just translate examples in the training, validation and test sets.
