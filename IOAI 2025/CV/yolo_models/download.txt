you'll need to download some models here: 

fast face detector yolov8n-face.pt: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qcr9DbgsX3ryrz2uU8w4Xm3cOrRywXqb/view 
note that you'll be changing the - in the filename to a _ then putting in this folder. 

i think the below can auto-download but here: 
fast person detector yolov8n.pt: https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v8.2.0/yolov8n.pt 



then this is not technically a yolo model but i'm just putting it in this folder for convenience (it's MiVOLO):
